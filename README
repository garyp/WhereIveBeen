"Where I've Been" app for the Locker Project
============================================

NOTE: This requires https://github.com/LockerProject/Locker/pull/408 to be
merged into your Locker repository.

Todo
----
- figure out what to do with low-accuracy latitude updates so that the
  overlapping red circles don't take over the whole screen
- fetch only places within the bounds of the map, and update as the user
  pans/zooms the map
- cluster nearby places into one marker at higher zoom levels
- limit fetched places by various criteria:
  - place source (foursquare, twitter, latitude, etc.)
  - place category on foursquare
- show more interesting information in the info window
- set hover text of twitter updates to the update text
